**WHAT IS THIS?**
======

Alot of people were asking if I could add their songs or how this thing works so I decided to create a new channel that will stream other redditors music from their music player at home/office even on phones to the internet for other people to listen to. in short, you can be your own DJ and broadcast to /rph Radio!



**WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?**

There are a couple of things that I thought you might want to do with this but are not limited to:

- Stream your own music collection from the office/home.
- Introduce us to your indie band or genre.
- Play your own podcast.
- Talk online LIVE or hold your own live talkshow.
- Record your show on your computer and broadcast it.
- Broadcast to your office/university.


**HOW DO I DO IT?**

There's three things that you need to be able to broadcast. a computer, an internet and a software to play songs and connect to the server.

 - **Computer:** Any computer or laptop that can play music. if you want to talk on-air, you need to have a microphone.
 - **Internet:** atleast 1mbps of internet. the faster the better ofcourse.
 - **Software:** I personally use Winamp because its easy to use and free but you 
can use other software aslong as it can connect to Icecast server. 


You may now go to the **<a href='{{< ref "players.md" >}}'>Audio Player page</a>** to see what softwares you can use to stream online.
