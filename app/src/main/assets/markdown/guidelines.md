Since there are a couple of people who want to try this, I made an excel file for the timeslot and the channel for redditors to block.

- To block the timeslot, you need to put your username and the show you will be doing on each cell per hour.
 
- You may block 1 or more hour depending on how long you want to broadcast but I would suggest to keep it at low (6 hours or so) unless there are no redditors that block the timeslot that you want.
 
**LIVE CHANNEL CREDENTIALS**

If you are ready to broadcast, use the below credentials to connect to the live channel in the front page:

Go to **<a href='{{< ref "home.md" >}}'>homepage</a>** and share your channel. enjoy!
