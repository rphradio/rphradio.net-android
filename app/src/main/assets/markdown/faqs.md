**WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE?**

Since online streaming/radio is blocked on our office, I made my own for personal use.

**WHAT'S THE CATCH**

Nothing. I don't ask for payment or donation for you to be able to broadcast, though you may treat me for a coffee if you like. what I only ask is that if you want to promote something on the channels at least get it to bare minimum. we don't like ads right?

**DO YOU COLLECT ANY INFO?**

I can only look at the number of current listeners per channel. I don't collect or store any information on who is listening or broadcasting.

**THERES ONLY ONE LIVE CHANNEL?**

In order for listeners to focus on only one channel live channel. this will do for now but might change in the future.

**WHY OPENSOURCE**

I encourage people to get into learning programming specially students. I made it super simple to study, distribute or modify. you may visit the git page of this site to download the code and check out the technology running behind this website.
